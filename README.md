A)
 Elasticity refers to the cloud's capability to automatically adjust computing resources based on demand. In deep learning, this allows systems to allocate more GPU or CPU power when workloads increase and reduce them when demand drops, optimizing both performance and cost.
  Scalability is the ability of a cloud infrastructure to handle growing workloads by either expanding resource capacity (scaling up) or adding more resources (scaling out). This ensures that deep learning models can efficiently process large datasets without performance issues.

B)
